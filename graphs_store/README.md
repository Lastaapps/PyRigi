# Graphs dataset

This file lists sources of the graph classes and generation tools used
to create some static graphs. Benchmarks later use these and other
runtime generated graphs to perform algorithms comparison.


## Laman graphs

Laman graphs are stored in the nauty directory. They were generated using
[Nauty](https://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/) and
[nauty-laman-plugin](https://github.com/martinkjlarsson/nauty-laman-plugin).

We swiftly describe the folder contents:
- `./nauty/laman_all` - holds all the Laman graphs with the given number of vertices.
- `./nauty/laman_some` - holds first 128 Laman graphs generated by nauty for the given size.
- `./nauty/laman_deg_3` - holds first 128 Laman graphs generated by nauty that have minimum degree of 3.

For benchmarks random Laman graphs are also used as nauty generates graphs
that are quite similar - this is also the case for larger graph sizes
where it becomes faster to find random graphs that are different enough from each other.
Random Laman graphs are stored in the `./random/laman` folder.

## No 3 nor 4 cycles

The class of graphs that have no 3 nor 4 cycles was obtained from
[users.cecs.anu.edu.au (external)](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/extremal.html).

For previous testing we also used some graph classes from
[users.cecs.anu.edu.au](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/graphs.html).
Unfortunately these were not as interesting as not large enough graphs were available.
