# Benchmarks

## How to run

We use the `pytest-benchmark` plugin for `pytest`.
Run the benchmarks by running `pytest benchmarks -m benchmark`.

## Data sources

### Redundantly rigid and Globally rigid graphs

`./benchmarks/graphs_store/RedundantRigidGraphs *.zip`
`./benchmarks/graphs_store/GloballyRigidGraphs *.zip`

The dataset is downloaded from `https://zenodo.org/records/7473079`
and `https://zenodo.org/records/7473053`.
The dataset is downloaded and loaded using the `dataset.py` file.
We call to these graphs small graphs.

### Laman graphs

`./benchmarks/graphs_store/nauty-laman/`

Laman graphs are generated by running `./benchmarks/generate_laman_graphs.sh`.
[Nauty](https://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/) and
[nauty-laman-plugin](https://github.com/martinkjlarsson/nauty-laman-plugin)
are used to do so.

### General graphs

`./benchmarks/graphs_store/general-graphs/`

Other graphs are either generated by NetworkX itself, or downloaded from
https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/graphs.html.

We use datasets from these categories:
- Plane 5-regular simple connected graphs
- Nonhamiltonian planar cubic graphs
- Highly irregular graphs
- Hypohamiltonian graphs
- Self-complementary graphs

The files used in the benchmarks:
```
cubhypo28g5.s6
highlyirregular14.g6
highlyirregular15.g6
hypo18some.g6
hypo22some.g6
hypo26some.g6
selfcomp13.g6
selfcomp16.g6
```
