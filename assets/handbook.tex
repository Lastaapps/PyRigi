\section{Documentation}
Documentation can be generated from docstrings using \texttt{sphinx}
by executing \texttt{make} in the folder \texttt{doc}.
The extension \texttt{sphinx-math-dollar} has to be install
(it allows to use dollar signs to typeset inline and displayed math expressions).
New commands can be created by modifying \texttt{mathjax3\_config} in \texttt{doc/conf/py}.
