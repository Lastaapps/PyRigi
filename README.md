<!-- start-input -->

PyRigi is a Python package for research in rigidity and flexibility of bar-and-joint frameworks.
We use [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) for graph theory and [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/) for computations.  

## Installation and usage

We have not reached a stable version yet.
Hence, the current usage is to clone/download the package
from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/pyRigi/PyRigi).
In the root folder of the package, it can be used by
```python
from pyrigi import Graph, Framework
```
In the future, we will enable installation via `pip`.

## Documentation

The documentation of the `main` branch is available [online](https://pyrigi.github.io/PyRigi/).
For compiling it locally,
see the [development guide](https://pyrigi.github.io/PyRigi/development/howto).

An important part of the documentation is the mathematical background.
We specify the outputs of the methods in the package
by giving rigorous mathematical definitions.

## Questions and feature requests

We have a [Zulip chat](https://pyrigi.zulipchat.com),
where you can ask questions or propose new functionality.
If you want to get access to it, please, send an email to
[this address](mailto:external.dc4f45edef70cb7e0c621ad50377d9f1.show-sender.include-footer@streams.zulipchat.com).
You can also use the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/PyRigi/PyRigi/discussions).

To report bugs, please, create an [issue](https://github.com/PyRigi/PyRigi/issues/new/choose).

## Contributing

We appreciate contributions!
Do you have a new research result
about rigidity or flexibility of bar-joint frameworks
that could be implemented in the package?
[Let us know](https://github.com/PyRigi/PyRigi/issues/new/choose)!
Or even better, implement it and contribute to the package!

Except for coding, you can also help for instance
by extending the mathematical documentation or
creating tutorials.

If you want to contribute, please,
read the [development guide](https://pyrigi.github.io/PyRigi/development/howto)
and [contact us](mailto:external.dc4f45edef70cb7e0c621ad50377d9f1.show-sender.include-footer@streams.zulipchat.com).

The decision to create PyRigi was made by the participants of the workshop
[Code of Rigidity](https://www.ricam.oeaw.ac.at/specsem/specsem2024/workshop2/)
(March 11–15, 2024), which was part of the 
Special Semester on Rigidity and Flexibility at [RICAM](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ricam/), Linz, Austria.
