**PyRigi** is a general-purpose Python package for the rigidity and flexibility of bar-and-joint frameworks.

## Installation and usage

We have not reached a stable version yet.
Hence, the current usage is to clone/download the package from this repository.
In the root folder of the package, it can be used by
```python
from pyrigi import Graph, Framework
```
In future, we will enable installation via `pip`.

## Documentation

The documentation is available [online](https://pyrigi.github.io/PyRigi/).
For compiling it locally,
see the [development guide](https://pyrigi.github.io/PyRigi/development/howto.html).

An important part of the documentation is the mathematical background.
We specify the outputs of the methods in the package
by giving rigorous mathematical definitions.
