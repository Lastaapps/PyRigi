# Getting started


## Installation and usage

We have not reached a stable version yet,
but the latest version requiring at least Python 3.10
can be installed by
```
pip install pyrigi
```
Then it can be used by
```python
from pyrigi import Graph, Framework
```

Alternatively, one can clone/download the package
from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/pyRigi/PyRigi).
Installation for development is done via [Poetry](#dev-dependencies).
