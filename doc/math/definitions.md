:::{prf:definition} Realization
:label: def-realization

Let $G=(V_G,E_G)$ be a simple graph, $\KK$ be a field and $d\in\NN$.
A $d$-dimensional _realization_ of $G$ in $\KK^d$ is a map $p\colon V_G\rightarrow \KK^d$.
For convenience, for $v \in V$ we may denote $p(i)$ by $p_i$.

The realization $p$ is _quasi-injective_ if $p(u)\neq p(v)$ for every edge $uv\in E_G$.

:::{prf:definition} Framework
:label: def-framework

Let $G$ be a graph and let $p$ be a $d$-dimensional {prf:ref}`realization <def-realization>` of $G$.
The pair $(G, p)$ is a called a _$d$-dimensional framework_.

:::{prf:definition} Equivalent and congruent frameworks
:label: def-equivalent-framework

Two $d$-dimensional frameworks $(G, p)$ and $(G, p')$ with $G = (V, E)$ are called _equivalent_ if

\begin{equation*}
 \left\| p_i - p_j \right\| = \left\| p'_i - p'_j \right\|
 \quad \text{ for all } \{i, j\} \in E \,.
\end{equation*}

Two $d$-dimensional frameworks $(G, p)$ and $(G, p')$ with $G = (V, E)$ are called _congruent_ if

\begin{equation*}
 \left\| p_i - p_j \right\| = \left\| p'_i - p'_j \right\|
 \quad \text{ for all } i, j \in V \,.

:::{prf:definition} Rigidity matrix
:label: def-rigidity-matrix

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph and $p$ be a $d$-dimensional realization of $G$.
The _rigidity matrix_ $R(G, p)$ of the framework $(G, p)$ is the $|E| \times d|V|$ matrix whose row labelled by $e \in E$ with $e = \{i,j\}$ is

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{array}{rcccccccl}
    &   &        & i           &        & j \\
  ( & 0 & \cdots & p_i - p_j & \cdots & p_j - p_i & \cdots & 0 &) \,.
  \end{array}

:::{prf:definition} Infinitesimal flexes
:label: def-inf-flex

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph and $p \colon V \rightarrow \KK^d$ be a $d$-dimensional realization of $G$.
An _infinitesimal flex_ of the framework $(G, p)$ is a collection $(q_v)_{v \in V}$ of elements in $\KK^n$ such that

\begin{equation*}
 (p_i - p_j) \cdot (q_i - q_j) = 0
 \quad \text{for all } e \in E
 \text{ with } e = \{i,j\} \,.
\end{equation*}

In other words, if we form a $d|V| \times 1$ vector $q$ out of an infinitesimal flex, then $q$ lies in the kernel of the rigidity matrix $R(G, p)$.

:::{prf:definition} Trivial infinitesimal flexes
:label: def-trivial-inf-flex

For any graph $G = (V, E)$ and any $d$-dimensional realization $p \colon V \rightarrow \KK^d$, a _trivial infinitesimal flex_ is any element of the vector subspace of $\KK^{d|V|}$ generated by the following elements:

* $(e_i)_{v \in V}$ where $e_i$ is the $i$-th element of the standard basis of $\KK^d$;
* $(A \cdot p_v)_{v \in V}$ where $A$ is any $d \times d$ skew-symmetric matrix.

An infinitesimal flex that is not trivial is called a _nontrivial infinitesimal flex_.

:label: def-gen-rigid

Let $G$ be a graph and $d \in \NN$.
The graph $G$ is called _generically $d$-rigid_ if for any $d$-dimensional realization $p$ whose coordinates are algebraically independent, the framework $(G, p)$ is continuously rigid; this is equivalent to $(G, p)$ being infinitesimally rigid.

A realization $p$ whose coordinates are algebraically independent is called _generic_.

:::{prf:definition} $(k, \ell)$-sparse and $(k, \ell)$-tight
:label: def-kl-sparse-tight

Let $G = (V_G, E_G)$ be a (multi)graph and let $k, \ell \in \NN$.
Set $n = |V_G|$ and $m = |E_G|$.
The graph $G$ is said to be _$(k, \ell)$-sparse_ if every set of $n' \leq n$ vertices spans at most $kn' - \ell$ edges.
The graph $G$ is said to be _$(k, \ell)$-tight_ if it is $(k, \ell)$-sparse and $kn - \ell = m$.

:::{prf:definition} Infinitesimally rigid frameworks
:label: def-inf-rigid-framework

A framework is called _infinitesimally rigid_, if all its infinitesimal flexes are trivial. 
This is the case when either there is less than 1 vertex in the framework, making it 
trivially rigid, or the rigidity matrix has rank $d \cdot |V| - {d\choose 2}$, since 
there are ${d\choose 2}$ isometries of $\RR^d$.
