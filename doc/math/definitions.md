:::{prf:definition} Realization
:label: def-realization

Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple graph, $\KK$ be a field and $d\in\NN$.
A $d$-dimensional _realization_ of $G$ in $\KK^d$ is a map $p\colon V\rightarrow \KK^d$.
For convenience, for $v \in V$ we may denote $p(v)$ by $p_v$.

The realization $p$ is _quasi-injective_ if $p(u)\neq p(v)$ for every edge $uv\in E$.

:::{prf:definition} Framework
:label: def-framework

Let $G$ be a graph and let $p$ be a $d$-dimensional {prf:ref}`realization <def-realization>` of $G$.
The pair $(G, p)$ is a called a _$d$-dimensional framework_.

:::{prf:definition} Equivalent and congruent frameworks
:label: def-equivalent-framework

Two $d$-dimensional frameworks $(G, p)$ and $(G, p')$ with $G = (V, E)$ are called _equivalent_ if

\begin{equation*}
 \left\| p_u - p_v \right\| = \left\| p'_u - p'_v \right\|
 \quad \text{ for all } uv \in E \,.
\end{equation*}

Two $d$-dimensional frameworks $(G, p)$ and $(G, p')$ with $G = (V, E)$ are called _congruent_ if

\begin{equation*}
 \left\| p_u - p_v \right\| = \left\| p'_u - p'_v \right\|
 \quad \text{ for all } u, v \in V \,.

:::{prf:definition} Rigidity matrix
:label: def-rigidity-matrix

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph and $p$ be a $d$-dimensional realization of $G$.
The _rigidity matrix_ $R(G, p)$ of the framework $(G, p)$ is the $|E| \times d|V|$ matrix whose row labelled by $uv \in E$ is

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{array}{rccccccccccccl}
    &   &        &   & u     & &       &        & v \\
  ( & 0 & \cdots & 0 & p_u - p_v & 0 & \cdots & 0 & p_v - p_u & 0 & \cdots & 0 &) \,.

:::{prf:definition} Infinitesimal flexes
:label: def-inf-flex

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph and $p \colon V \rightarrow \KK^d$ be a $d$-dimensional realization of $G$.
An _infinitesimal flex_ of the framework $(G, p)$ is a collection $(q_v)_{v \in V}$ of elements in $\KK^n$ such that

\begin{equation*}
 (p_u - p_v) \cdot (q_u - q_v) = 0
 \quad \text{for all } uv \in E\,.
\end{equation*}

In other words, if we form a $d|V| \times 1$ vector $q$ out of an infinitesimal flex, then $q$ lies in the kernel of the rigidity matrix $R(G, p)$.

:::{prf:definition} Trivial infinitesimal flexes
:label: def-trivial-inf-flex

For any graph $G = (V, E)$ and any $d$-dimensional realization $p \colon V \rightarrow \KK^d$, a _trivial infinitesimal flex_ is any element of the vector subspace of $\KK^{d|V|}$ generated by the following elements:

* $(e_i)_{v \in V}$ where $e_i$ is the $i$-th element of the standard basis of $\KK^d$;
* $(A \cdot p_v)_{v \in V}$ where $A$ is any $d \times d$ skew-symmetric matrix.

An infinitesimal flex that is not trivial is called a _nontrivial infinitesimal flex_.

:::{prf:definition} Infinitesimally rigid frameworks
:label: def-inf-rigid-framework

A framework is called _infinitesimally rigid_, if all its infinitesimal flexes are trivial.
A framework is called _infinitesimally flexible_, if it is not infinitesimally rigid.

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph and $p$ be a $d$-dimensional realization of $G$.
If $|V| \geq d+1$, the framework $(G, p)$ is infinitesimally rigid if and only if the rigidity matrix $R(G, p)$ has rank $d|V| - \binom{d+1}{2}$.
If $|V| \leq d+1$, the framework $(G, p)$ is infinitesimally rigid if and only if $G$ is complete, $p$ is injective and the set $\{ p_v \, : \, v \in V\}$ is affinely independent.

:::{prf:definition} Continuous flexes
:label: def-flex

Let $(G, p)$ be a $d$-dimensional framework.
A _continuous flex_ is a continuous map $\alpha \colon [0, 1] \rightarrow (\RR^{d})^V$ such that

* $\alpha(0) = p$;
* $(G, p)$ and $(G, \alpha(t))$ are equivalent for every $t \in [0,1]$.

A continuous flex is called _trivial_ if $(G, p)$ and $(G, \alpha(t))$ are congruent for every $t \in [0,1]$.

:::{prf:definition} Continuously rigid frameworks
:label: def-cont-rigid-framework

A framework $(G, p)$ is called _continuously rigid_ (from now on, simply _rigid_) if each of its continuous flexes is trivial.
A framework $(G, p)$ is called _flexible_ if it is not rigid.

:::{prf:definition} Regular frameworks
:label: def-regular-frameworks

A $d$-dimensional framework $(G, p)$ is called _regular_ if

\begin{equation*}
 \mathrm{rk} \, R(G, p) \geq \mathrm{rk} \, R(G, p')

for any other $d$-dimensional framework $(G, p')$.

:::{prf:definition} Independent frameworks

:::{prf:definition} Isostatic frameworks
:label: def-isostatic-frameworks

A framework $(G, p)$ is called _isostatic_ if it is infinitesimally rigid and independent.
:::


:::{prf:definition} Generically rigid graph
:label: def-gen-rigid

Let $G$ be a graph and $d \in \NN$.
The graph $G$ is called _generically $d$-rigid_ if for any $d$-dimensional realization $p$ whose coordinates are algebraically independent, the framework $(G, p)$ is continuously rigid; this is equivalent to $(G, p)$ being infinitesimally rigid.

A realization $p$ whose coordinates are algebraically independent is called _generic_.

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a (multi)graph and let $k, \ell \in \NN$.
Set $n = |V|$ and $m = |E|$.
The graph $G$ is said to be _$(k, \ell)$-sparse_ if every set of $n' \leq n$ vertices spans at most $kn' - \ell$ edges.
The graph $G$ is said to be _$(k, \ell)$-tight_ if it is $(k, \ell)$-sparse and $kn - \ell = m$.
