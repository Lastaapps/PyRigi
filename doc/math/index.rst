.. _realization:

.. proof:definition:: realization

	Let $G$ be a graph, $\KK$ be a field and $d\in\NN$.
	A $d$-dimensional *realization* of $G$ in $\KK^d$ is a map $p\colon V_G\rightarrow \KK^d$.

.. proof:definition:: Framework

	Let $G$ be a graph and let $p$ be a $d$-dimensional :ref:`realization` of $G$.
	The pair $(G, p)$ is a called a framework.
